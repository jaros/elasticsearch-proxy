- AdminApp -> has system (adminApp) token (master key for authorization) -> token (master key)
- ScalaElasticApp -> also has master key which is unique per cluster (instance) and it knows[hardcoded] AdminApp's key


1. ScalaElasticApp [app 1st time initialized] -> sends request to AdminApp [provides it's own masterKey] -> to AdminApp

2. AdminApp authorizes the request and stores the obtained token

3. AdminApp sends control operations to elasticSearch through ScalaApp (each request must have authorization token) and control security

4. ScalaApp sends info about indeces(size, number of records per index) to AdminApp aggregated through batch job (run each hour)


* Admin app [index_name] equals to ES [type] (for now)

Operations per index(actual type)
1. Synchronize -> create new type in index (index is created if needed as)
2. Delete
